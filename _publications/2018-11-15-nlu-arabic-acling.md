permalink: /publication/2018-11-15-nlu-arabic-acling
excerpt: 'This paper presents an approach to use deep learning techniques for text classification and Named Entity Recognition for the domain of home automation in Arabic. To this end, we present an NLU module that can further be integrated with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), a Dialogue Manager (DM) and a Natural Language Generator (NLG) module to build a fully working dialogue system. The paper further describes our process of collecting and annotating the data, structuring the intent classifier and entity extractor
models, and finally the evaluation of these methods on different benchmarks.
