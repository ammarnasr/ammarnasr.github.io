title: "Neural Natural Language Understanding for Arabic Dialogue Systems [Paper]"
excerpt: "
We built an NLU  (using Neural Networks) for Arabic home automation assistants. Using Keras and Tensorflow we benchmarked CNN and LSTM in text classification. for named entity recognition we used BiLSTM. the paper won the outstanding paper award in [ACLing2018](https://www.acling.org/).
